To combat that, the very watery ingredients \u2013 mushrooms, tofu, beans and beets \u2013 are roasted to both dehydrate them somewhat and intensify their flavors. Yes, the ingredient list here is long; you need a diverse lot to make a good veggie burger. And each one adds something in terms of flavor and/or texture. Garnish this any way you like, and don\u2019t forget to toast the buns."},

{"description": "This formula for p\u00e2te sucr\u00e9e comes from the pastry chef Jacquy Pfeiffer, with whom I wrote a book. It may surprise you that everything, even the butter, is at room temperature when you mix the dough. Room temperature butter will mix together thoroughly and quickly with the other ingredients, so you won\u2019t find chunks of it when you roll out the dough. It also allows you to mix the dough quickly, minimizing air bubbles and the development of the gluten in the flour, which would result in too much elasticity in the dough, causing it to shrink during baking. He uses powdered sugar, rather than granulated, because it melts and combines quickly with other ingredients, again allowing you to mix the dough quickly. Almond flour contributes flavor to the dough and gives it a nice texture, but you could substitute regular flour if you have a hard time finding almond flour. Finally, he uses cake flour because it has a lower gluten content than all-purpose flour.", "ingredients": ["sea salt", "almond flour", "vanilla extract", "egg", "cake flour"], "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/09/24/dining/24DESSERT2/24DESSERT2-articleLarge.jpg", "title": "Sweet Tart Dough", "original_url": "/recipes/1016816-sweet-tart-dough", "recipe_yield": "Two 9-inch pastry shells", "uid": "1016816"},

Use the same formula for peaches, apricots and figs when those fruits are in season. The important thing to remember when making fresh fruit tarts with cut stone fruit is that you need to pack the fruit into the pastry tightly. If you don\u2019t, the fruit will collapse in the shell as it bakes, and it will lose a lot of liquid, which could make the pastry shell soggy. Another way to prevent the shell from becoming soggy is to line it with crumbs of one kind or another \u2014 they can be cookie crumbs or breadcrumbs, crumble topping or streusel, that will absorb the juice from the fruit."},

It amounts to simple cutting of kernels from the last of the season's corn cobs, and warming them in good olive oil with garlic, some scallions and a bit of chopped fresh vegetables, then finishing it all with chopped herbs. If corn season has ended, tender butter beans from a can, drained and rinsed, make a perfect substitute. Served with a wedge of good cheese and a thick cut of bread, the salad becomes part of a simple but complete meal, to be eaten in your own good company."},

{"description": "Trahana is a wheat product that is eaten throughout Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean. There are many versions, some made with milk, usually from goats or sheep that is called sweet trahana, some with a combination of milk and yogurt, called sour trahana, and even a lenten version made with vegetable pulp. The liquid is combined with wheat \u2013 bulgur, semolina, or a mix of semolina and flour \u2013 and made into a dry dough (if using flour) or simmered until it is a thick porridge. Then it is spread out on netting and dried in the sun. Once thoroughly dry it is broken up into granules that can range in size from bulgurlike morsels to small pellets.

{"description": "When I order a whole wheat bagel in a coffee shop what I get is a white bagel with a little bit of whole wheat flour thrown in. These bagels are different; they are truly whole grain. I\u2019ve been enthralled lately with Peter Reinhart\u2019s new cookbook, Bread Revolution. Reinhart, a baking teacher and cookbook author whom I have long admired, has discovered the magic of sprouted whole grain flours, which he uses in the recipes in this book (you can get sprouted whole wheat flour in whole foods stores and from several online sources). He also illuminates many of the mysteries of baking with whole grain flours in general. The recipes that I have tried work with regular whole wheat flour as well; I have Community Grains whole wheat flour on hand but did not have sprouted whole wheat flour when I was developing this week\u2019s Recipes for Health, so that is what I used. One of the important things I learned \u2013 relearned really \u2013 from Peter is that when you make dough with whole wheat flour, which absorbs liquid more readily than white flour, it is important to give the dough a little time to absorb the water so that it will be workable. So there is a rest after you add the liquid to the flour; you\u2019ll think the dough is going to be way too wet, then it miraculously firms up, in very little time. Reinhart has two methods for bagels in his cookbook; one requires an overnight rest in the refrigerator after shaping (that is the method I have used in the past), the other, made with sprouted wheat flour, can be boiled and baked after rising and shaping. If you use sprouted whole wheat flour Reinhart says the overnight rise isn\u2019t required because the sprouted wheat allows the bagels to develop optimum flavor in a shorter time. I couldn\u2019t discern much of a difference between the flavor of my overnight regular whole wheat bagels and those I made with the shorter rise; and the ones I made with the shorter rise were prettier. Barley malt is the traditional sweetener used in bagel dough and in the water bath, but either honey or agave syrup can be substituted.", "ingredients": ["whole wheat flour", "fine sea salt", "instant yeast", "water", "baking soda", "Cornmeal", "sesame seeds"], "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/12/30/science/recipehealthbagels/recipehealthbagels-articleLarge.jpg", "title": "Peter Reinhart\u2019s Whole Wheat Bagels", "original_url": "/recipes/1017092-peter-reinharts-whole-wheat-bagels", "recipe_yield": "8 bagels", "uid": "1017092"},
{"description": "These look like bagels with bigger holes, but the bread is denser and defined by the thick coating of sesame seeds that gives them their delicious flavor.  I first encountered simit in Athens, then in Egypt, where they are a popular street food, as they are in Turkey. In the past I have dipped the rings into beaten egg before coating with sesame seeds. But I\u2019ve been looking at various recipes lately and see that many Turkish bakers dip their rings into grape or pomegranate molasses diffused with water before coating. I like this method because it enhances the browning effect during baking and leaves a slightly sweet flavor on the surface of the breads. Turkish bakers also sometimes add a ground mahlab (sour cherry kernels) to their dough for added flavor. One way to ensure that most of the sesame seeds will continue to adhere to the breads after they cool is to brush with egg white when you rotate the pans after 20 minutes of baking. The version I am giving you is made with a combination of semolina, all-purpose and (mostly) whole wheat flour, which is totally inauthentic but nevertheless, delicious.

{"description": "Teff is a challenging grain to work with. The flavor is strong, the grains tiny, and the mixture stiffens up very quickly once the grains are cooked. The chef Jason Bond makes a comforting teff polenta at his Bondir restaurants in Cambridge and Concord, Mass. He cooks the teff on top of the stove, in milk, and adds a finely chopped chipotle chile to the mix, which contributes a nice smoky/hot flavor. I liked the idea of teff polenta, and tried a few different methods for it. Teff will cook up in about 20 minutes on top of the stove, but if you use the oven-baked method outlined here, modeled on the method I often use for cornmeal polenta, you will get a creamier result. The oven method takes much longer, but the time is unsupervised \u2013 no frequent stirring as you must do on the top of the stove. This method doesn\u2019t work so well if you use milk, however, because the milk forms too much skin in the oven, which forms curds when you stir the mixture (though I do like the flavor of the teff cooked in milk a lot). I tested the recipe using both stock and water, and liked both results equally. The chipotle adds a nice smoky/spicy flavor to the teff, but you can leave it out and just focus on the nutty flavor of the teff alone, with the hazelnut oil. I love the toasted hazelnut oil finish; it harmonizes with the nutty/earthy flavor of this grain. Serve the teff as a side dish or top with roasted vegetables or a vegetable or bean stew. You can also allow the teff to stiffen, then cut into squares and fry in the squares oil or grill them. You will get best results if you soak the teff for a few hours or overnight.", "ingredients": [], "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/01/17/science/recipehealthteff/recipehealthteff-articleLarge.jpg", "title": "Teff Polenta With Toasted Hazelnut Oil", "original_url": "/recipes/1017123-teff-polenta-with-toasted-hazelnut-oil", "recipe_yield": "Serves 6", "uid": "1017123"},

I serve thin slices with salads, or in place of a cracker, topped with something.

It worked that way, but I still found that the flavor of this food works better with sweet flavors, and the texture did not benefit from the long oven simmer, the way the teff did. So again, I decided that amaranth is best served as a breakfast porridge. I toasted the seeds in the pan before adding water, and this added a wonderful popcorn dimension to the flavor. The aroma of this cereal as it cooked reminded me of the smell of the whole wheat Ralston Hot Cereal that my mother used to make for me.

It is important to understand why you must cook these grits over the lowest possible heat: these are coarse grits, and if they are over-hydrated or boiled after they begin to thicken they will take forever to cook. (In technical terms, thickening is the point at which the first starch takes hold, or the point after continuous gentle stirring when the grits particles remain suspended in the liquid and you no longer have to stir continuously).

Start the preparation on the evening before you have a day off. A few hours of cooking the next day yields a dinner of remarkable heft and deliciousness, one that pairs well with red wine and good friends."},
