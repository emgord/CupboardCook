[{"description": "To add some funk to Manischewitz, the notoriously sweet kosher wine that\u2019s used as often for a punchline as, say, a punch ingredient, Jill Schulster, the co-owner of JoeDoe, mixed it with Old Pogue bourbon along with a splash of lemon juice and some mellowing fizz from club soda. \u201cTo remind you that it\u2019s Passover,\u201d Ms. Schulster said, she added a chunky and slightly chewy rim of crushed matzo, tempered with confectioner\u2019s sugar, to the glass the drink is served in. While the Manischewitz\u2019s cloying sweetness comes through (one suspects it would take a full gallon of bourbon to subdue that candied Concord grapiness), the drink is determinedly balanced, and rather festive to boot.", "ingredients": ["bourbon", "Manischewitz wine", "lemon juice", "Club soda", "Sugared matzo"], "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/04/22/dining/pharoah-still/pharoah-still-articleLarge.jpg", "title": "Drunken Pharaoh", "original_url": "/recipes/1012377-drunken-pharaoh", "recipe_yield": "1 serving", "uid": "1012377"},

After the rice is rinsed well, it is parboiled for about 5 minutes and drained. The half-cooked rice is layered into a well-buttered pot along with the chopped dried fruits. Over a moderate flame, it is allowed to brown gently before being splashed with a small amount of saffron-infused water.

Alain Sailhac, dean emeritus of the French Culinary Institute in New York and one of New York\u2019s most venerable French chefs, gives inspiration here. He suggests cutting the breast in half horizontally to make two thin pieces, then topping them with quick-cooking vegetables like mushrooms, zucchini or tomatoes, and roasting everything in a hot oven (or toaster oven).

Meanwhile, make a sauce from tamarind paste, now easily found in supermarkets. The paste, made from the pulp of the tamarind pod, is very sour, but more complex than citrus.

It is both sharply hot and herbaceously cool, especially with the addition of mint to play up the whiff of eucalyptus in the wines. In this recipe, though, the chimichurri is not really a sauce.

Razor clams are much more perishable than hard clams, but their shelf life can be extended by steaming them for use in salads later. Shaunna Sargent, the chef at Corsino restaurant in Manhattan, is among the chefs who froze the clams for a few hours to make the meat easier to remove and more tender.

This combo of lentils and greens is inspired by a classic preparation for the tasty French Le Puy green lentils that traditionally includes salt pork and/or bacon and sausage. For this vegetarian version, I don\u2019t insist on Le Puy lentils, although I highly recommend them. Meat eaters in the family might want to accompany this with sausage, cooked separately or with the lentils. I recommend topping the lentils with goat cheese or feta."},
