Combine the rice with water, bring to a boil, reduce the heat, cover tightly and simmer over very low heat for 15 minutes. Once the water has evaporated from the pot, place a towel between the lid of the pot and the rice, and let it sit for ten minutes to absorb more moisture and steam. The amount of liquid you choose to use will affect the texture of your rice. A 2-to-1 ratio, liquid to rice, produces soft, tender rice. Chewier rice will result from using a 1-to-1 ratio, or from adding a bit more water. I usually go with a 2-to-1 ratio for cooking a long-grain rice like basmati. Traditionally, basmati rice first is soaked for 30 minutes to as long as two hours. The grains are brittle, but if they absorb a little water they are less likely to break while cooking. Still, I have to admit that there are many times that I don\u2019t soak my basmati rice \u2014 and I can\u2019t really tell the difference."},

A chief virtue of many domestic chestnut cultivars, Ms. Petitt added, is that the \u201cbitter peel stays attached to the shell, instead of the nut.\u201d So, no imports. At home, snip the chestnuts in half, on the horizontal axis, with kitchen shears. Next, place them in a colander and immerse in boiling water. After 3 or 4 minutes, the shells should bubble to the surface. Now the nuts can be boiled until crumbly (about 15 minutes) or moved to the oven. This technique could not be easier, except when it fails. In that event, leave the nuts boiling for 10 minutes total. At this point, the shells and skins should easily slip off. Plan B is to roast the nuts. Score the flat side with an X and place nuts, cut side down, in a glass baking dish. Pour 1/4 inch of water into the bottom, and roast the nuts for 15 to 20 minutes in a 375-degree oven. To peel (while hot), pinch the sides gently."},

I prefer to cut the carrots into a fine julienne rather than use a box grater, which makes them a bit raggedy. The julienne carrots have a more appealing texture, and they look gorgeous piled on a platter, scattered with chives. It\u2019s not necessary to stay absolutely traditional with this salad. I often veer North African with it, adding pinches of cumin, cinnamon and hot pepper. Nor would it be out of place to introduce Vietnamese seasonings like cilantro, mint, fish sauce and lime."},

I\u2019d always been a bit flummoxed by this uneven cooking and the texture of the broken-down millet (it\u2019s a bit chalky). But serving it like a polenta makes perfect sense. You can serve it soft, right after it\u2019s cooked, or let it set up and then slice it and crisp the slices or use them in gratins, as I do with cornmeal polenta.

Contrary to what you might think, the mai tai is actually just a rum sour, employing orgeat alongside Cura\u00e7ao or triple sec as the sweetener, and using two rums to add complexity. The rest is just lime juice, and that\u2019s it. No coconut, no passion fruit, pineapple, mango or orange juice. No umbrellas. It\u2019s a relatively simple drink, but as such, each element has to be of the utmost quality; great rums, fresh lime juice and prefab orgeat syrup equal disappointment. But when concocted with homemade orgeat, all the tumblers click.

Orge is the French for \u201cbarley,\u201d and orgeat, orzata or, in Spanish, horchata, originally referred to a common method of making barley water, a nourishing drink, by crushing the grain in a mortar and pestle and adding water to it to emulsify the fats.

This could be made as a simple syrup, but its hard then to adjust the sweetness for differing tastes and applications. Sometimes you want to incorporate it as a sour into drinks that have other sweetened ingredients; and if you want to use the pulp on ice cream or sweetened yogurt, keeping it tart is a better option.

Instead of boiling the noodles Italian-style, the Catalan way is to cook them with only a small amount of liquid in a wide earthenware cazuela or paella pan. Here, the noodles are first browned in olive oil, then simmered in a rich fish and shellfish broth. It\u2019s a sort of cross between risotto and paella, and it\u2019s a dish for all lovers of Mediterranean fish soups in the bouillabaisse family. Broth is added at intervals as it is absorbed, but not much stirring is involved. A dab of garlicky allioli, the Spanish version of a\u00efoli, is added to each soup plate before serving."},
