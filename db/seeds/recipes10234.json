My thinking about pasta dishes has evolved, and the more-sauce-less-pasta approach that\u2019s emerged is one that\u2019s pretty brilliant, if I do say so myself. So, it was a bit of a shock to look back at my original recipe and find that, for four people, I called for a full pound of pasta but only two cups of arugula. The resulting dish is delicious, thanks to garlic and anchovies, but uniformly starchy and a bit lacking in textural and flavor contrast. You can barely even taste the arugula when there\u2019s only a half-cup in each serving. So I decided to do a little tweaking. My new version contains almost equal parts cooked pasta and raw arugula.

It is an industrial food product (and so's your hanger steak, pal), but it's a more than decent one. And at $4.99 a pound, dinner for four costs less than $20. But it also makes an excellent breakfast. At the Hope & Anchor restaurant in Red Hook, Brooklyn, Dianna Munz served a barbecued ham and scallion hash with two fried eggs, but sometimes hash is better consumed at home. Made with Porkette, Munz's dish takes on a slightly gruffer flavor that is matched perfectly by the sweet of the barbecue sauce and the thick run of an easy-cooked egg yolk. Members of the smart set will cut their potatoes thin the night before. This makes the final preparation of the dish on a weekend morning a snap. Just add hot coffee."},

{"description": "Pamela Sherrid\u2019s summer pasta, which The Times ran a recipe for in 1996, is a quintessential crossover dish: part tomatoes and warm pasta, part pasta salad and the best of both. It includes ripe summer tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, basil and cubes of fresh mozzarella. Ms. Sherrid\u2019s recipe relies on prudent technique and a slacker\u2019s sense of pace. First you combine the garlic, basil and oil and let the mixture macerate. A few hours later you add tomatoes and let it sit some more. Next, you pour the cooked rigatoni over the tomatoes, and cubes of mozzarella over the rigatoni. Then you gently mix the cheese into the pasta, coating it with a buttery veil of fat, before tossing it with the tomatoes at the bottom. If you have great tomatoes and mozzarella and you don\u2019t overcook the pasta, it is a remarkably good dish. A puddle of sweet and salty tomato broth will form at the bottom of your bowl, so make sure you have some bread on hand to soak it up.", "ingredients": ["garlic", "olive oil", "basil leaves", "tomatoes", "Salt", "rigatoni", "mozzarella", "Country bread"], "image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2014/05/13/dining/Summer-Pasta/Summer-Pasta-articleLarge.jpg", "title": "Pamela Sherrid's Summer Pasta", "original_url": "/recipes/11718-pamela-sherrids-summer-pasta", "recipe_yield": "6 servings", "uid": "11718"},

Take a bunch of raw Tuscan kale (also called lacinato or black kale), which is more delicate than other varieties, and slice it into ribbons. Toss those ribbons with a thick bright dressing of garlic paste, pecorino, lemon juice, olive oil and a pinch of red pepper flakes. Top with freshly toasted bread crumbs and a flurry of pecorino.

Aristocratic Russians of the time had commercial and cultural ties with France, and many upper-class Russians employed French cooks, who were always looking for ways to give French dishes a Russian twist. One of the most prominent families of the time was the Stroganoffs, who spent much time in Paris and had developed a love for French cuisine. Beef stroganoff is believed to have been created when the family chef added some sour cream, a Russian staple, to what was essentially a beef dish in a classic French mustard sauce. Here, Mr. Franey substitutes meatballs for the steak. The results are slightly lighter than the classic dish but full of flavor."},

One bright light after the storms was an unexpected windfall in crab. The storms stirred up the marshes and shook up lots of food, so these crab cakes are made with an ice cream scoop and not a spoon. The real gem of the dish is the Crystal beurre blanc, an idea that mixes high French culinary canon with down-and-dirty New Orleans heat. Crystal Hot Sauce has long adorned many a table in New Orleans. It is more vinegary than Tabasco, which is too hot for this recipe. Baumer Foods had been making Crystal Hot Sauce for more than eight decades when the storms hit. Its New Orleans plant was flooded so badly that it was not reopened, but other bottlers kept Crystal on the shelves until the company could move into its new home, about a half hour\u2019s drive from its damaged factory."},

The Sephardim were the Jews of the Iberian Peninsula; they had a rich culture and lived in harmony with Christians and Muslims until the Spanish and Portuguese Inquisitions at the end of the 15th century, when all non-Christians were expelled from Spain and Portugal. The Sephardim were welcomed in Turkey, and many went to Greece, North Africa and the Middle East as well. Throughout the Mediterranean, springtime is the season for spinach and other greens, artichokes and fava beans, and these vegetables make delicious appearances at Passover meals. This dish is inspired by the fresh fava bean soup that Rivka Levy-Mellul, author of \u201cLa Cuisine Juive Marocaine,\u201d remembers as the first course of her childhood Seders in Morocco. The authentic dish is a substantial soup made with quite a lot of meat, but I\u2019ve made a vegetarian version. I expected the fava beans to color this soup a pale green, but the other vegetables  \u2014 the carrots, leeks, turnips and onion \u2014 and especially the turmeric contribute just as much, and the color of the soup is more of a burnt orange."},

Two types that are commonly available are reddish-purple dulse and bright green wakame. Both simply need bathing in cold water for a few minutes to soften and ready them for use.

Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and refrigerate until you\u2019re ready to clean and cook them. The main work that goes into cooking mussels is the careful picking over that must be done first, to make sure there are no dead mussels. Rinse the mussels in several times in cold water and examine each one. If there are cracks in the shell, or if a mussel is open and doesn\u2019t close back up when you tap the shell, throw it away. If the shells have lots of algae, seaweed or barnacles on them, you can brush them or scrape them with the edge of the shell of another mussel. Finally, pull out the beards. This should not be done until shortly before cooking as mussels can die once the beards have been pulled. Discard any that remain closed after cooking."},

But here\u2019s a recipe with a clever tweak on that method, one that\u2019s easier than spatchcocking (or butterflying) the chicken, and that makes for a even faster-cooked, juicier bird. Preheat the skillet in a 500-degree oven for about 45 minutes, letting it get blisteringly hot. Meanwhile, take the chicken and snip the skin that connects the legs to the body, splaying the legs open until you feel the joints pop on both sides. Very carefully transfer the chicken to the pan, pressing the legs down into the surface. Ramps, garlic and capers tossed into the pan juices toward the end of the roasting time make for a bright, sweet and salty sauce.

So, I decided to change the grain-to-water ratio and followed the directions on my Alter Eco quinoa packages (Alter Eco imports red, rainbow and pearl quinoas). I cooked the pearl and the red quinoas in 1 1/2 parts water and the rainbow in 2 parts water. The black quinoa in the rainbow mix takes a little longer to soften and requires a little more liquid. The grains were tighter and less moist than quinoa cooked in abundant water, and the yield was not as great because the grains don\u2019t swell as much.

Make sure to dust your work surface well before you roll out the pastry, and to let the dough rest for a few minutes after each few passes with the rolling pin so that it doesn\u2019t shrink back, as yeast doughs do.

The cod should be rinsed and soaked overnight, but that doesn\u2019t take much effort. For tender fish, the trick is not to overcook it. Keep the flame low, just under a simmer. Cooking the fish in a combination of milk and water, along with a few aromatics like bay leaf, thyme, clove and peppercorns, will keep the fish sweet. While the cod is warm, flake it into a bowl and roughly mash with potatoes and moisten with garlicky olive oil and cream. A bit of cooking liquid is added to lighten the mixture.

The volatile oils contain components that have been shown to inhibit the activity of harmful elements in the body, and studies have attributed antioxidant properties to the flavonoids, particularly luteolin. It\u2019s important to pick the parsley leaves off the stems, because unlike the stems of cilantro, parsley stems are tough and should be discarded.
